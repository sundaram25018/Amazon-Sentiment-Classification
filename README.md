## *** Steps to Perform Sentiment Analysis ***
<b>Data Collection:</b> Gather text data, such as tweets, product reviews, or survey responses.
<br><br>

Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation, stop words, and numbers.
Tokenize and stem or lemmatize the text.<br><br>
<b>Feature Extraction:</b>
Represent the text as numerical data using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).<br><br>
<b>Modeling:</b>
Use pretrained models like VADER, TextBlob, or BERT for quick sentiment analysis.
Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, SVM) or deep learning models for custom sentiment analysis.<br><br>
<b>Evaluation:</b>
Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.<br><br>
<b>Prediction:</b>
Classify new text data into sentiment categories like Positive, Neutral, or Negative.<br><br>
